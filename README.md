# comey-project
Named after FBI Director James Comey, the Comey Project is dedicated to encryption of user data on the cloud, a project I'm sure he would approve of /s.

I have worked alot on this project in PHP. Mid-project, I figured that I should not continue on using PHP and just rewrite it in Java.

I'll be using Google Console to upload the builds for testing.
